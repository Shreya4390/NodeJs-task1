# Importing and exporting files are important parts of any programming language. 
Importing functions or modules enhances the reusability of code. When the application 
grows in size, maintaining a single file with all the functions and logic becomes difficult.
 It also hinders the process of debugging. Therefore, it is good practice to create separate files 
 for specific functions and later import them as per requirement.

Node.js also allows importing and exporting functions and modules. Functions in 
one module can be imported and called in other modules saving the effort to copy function 
definitions into the other files. The module can be edited or debugged separately making it easier to add or remove features.
